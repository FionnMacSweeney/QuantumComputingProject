    "The development of quantum theory was improved on a great deal over the 1900s, with input coming from great scientist such as Planck, Einstein, de Broglie and Heisenberg. One major interpretation that really helps to get a bit of a grasp of quantum theory is the Copenhagen Interpretation and the analogy of Schrodinger's Cat. <br>\n",

    "A great way to wrap your head around this theory is the somewhat cruel analogy of <b>Schrodinger's Cat</b>. \n",
    "Imagine you have a living cat and harshly put it into a lead box. At this point you know that the cat is still alive as you have just put the cat in. Then imagine you put a vial of poison or cyanide into the box. At this point you cannot be certain if the cat is now alive or dead. Since you are uncertain, the cat is technically in a state of being both alive and dead. This is known as <b>superposition</b>, which you will hear us speak about again. The cat is technically in this state of superposition until someone finally opens the box to observe the cat to see it's fate. This scenario is basically the basis behing quantum physics.\n",

Specifically, quantum computing uses these particles to represent and manipulate information in the form of quantum bits, or qubits which we will talk about later. <br>\n",

    "The first quantum algorithm to outperform the best classical algorithm was the Deustch-Jozsa algorithm. This algorithm demonstrated that quantum computers can provide certain advantages as computational tools for particular problems. <br>\n",
    "The problem we are facing here is to determine whether a boolean function is constant or balanced. A function is constant if it returns the same value for all of the inputs, a function is balanced if it returns half of the inputs as 0 and half as 1. <br>\n",
    "The classical solution requires evaluating the function for n inputs to determine whether it is constant or balanced. This takes O(2^(n-1)) time where n is equal to the size of the input. <br>\n",
    "The quantum solution uses the Deustch-Jozsa algorithm, which can solve the problem with just one function evaluation, this takes O(n^2) time.<br><br>\n",
    "It may help to understand the differeneces between the time complexities between these two algorithms. <br>The classical solution, which takes O(2^(n-1)) time, this is known as <b>exponential time</b>. This type of time complexity is known to be very slow and inefficient. This is because for every extra input that the algorithm takes, the time to complete the algorithm doubles from the previous amount of time. In a practical setting, it simply does not make sense to use this type of algorithm unless completely necessary, especially if there are a large amount of inputs.<br>\n",
    "However, in the quantum solution, it takes O(n^2) time. This is known as <b>polynomial time</b>. Polynomial time is a much faster and more efficient time complexity than exponential time and the time it takes grows at a much slower rate. For this type of time complexity, as the input size doubles, the amount of quantum gates required to implement the algorithm increases by a factor of 4. This makes polynomial time magnitudes of times faster than exponential time. <br>\n",
    "I will give you a quick example to explain the difference of magnitude between the two time complexities.\n",
    "Lets consider the size of the input is n = 20. The polynomial time algorithm would take only 400 units of time (20^2), whereas the exponential time algorithm would take around one million units of time (2^20). As you can see, the two time complexities are miles away from eachother in regards to efficiency. \n"
