    "The development of quantum theory was improved on a great deal over the 1900s, with input coming from great scientist such as Planck, Einstein, de Broglie and Heisenberg. One major interpretation that really helps to get a bit of a grasp of quantum theory is the Copenhagen Interpretation and the analogy of Schrodinger's Cat. <br>\n",

    "A great way to wrap your head around this theory is the somewhat cruel analogy of <b>Schrodinger's Cat</b>. \n",
    "Imagine you have a living cat and harshly put it into a lead box. At this point you know that the cat is still alive as you have just put the cat in. Then imagine you put a vial of poison or cyanide into the box. At this point you cannot be certain if the cat is now alive or dead. Since you are uncertain, the cat is technically in a state of being both alive and dead. This is known as <b>superposition</b>, which you will hear us speak about again. The cat is technically in this state of superposition until someone finally opens the box to observe the cat to see it's fate. This scenario is basically the basis behing quantum physics.\n",

    "Quantum computing is then, an area of computer science that utilizes the principles of quantum theory. Quantum computing uses subatomic particles such as electrons and photons as the building blocks for it's information processing. Specifically, quantum computing uses these particles to represent and manipulate information in the form of quantum bits, or qubits which we will talk about later."
